\title{Compute the cross-validation for the ngme model
Perform cross-validation for ngme model
first into sub_groups (a list of target, and train data)}
\usage{
cross_validation(
  ngme,
  type = "k-fold",
  seed = NULL,
  print = FALSE,
  N = 100,
  k = 5,
  percent = 50,
  times = 10,
  test_idx = NULL,
  train_idx = NULL,
  keep_test_information = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ngme}{a ngme object, or a list of ngme object (if comparing multiple models)}

\item{type}{character, in c("k-fold", "loo", "lpo", "custom")
k-fold is k-fold cross-validation, provide \code{k}
loo is leave-one-out,
lpo is leave-percent-out, provide \code{percent} from 1 to 100
custom is user-defined group, provide \code{target} and \code{data}}

\item{seed}{random seed}

\item{print}{print information during computation}

\item{N}{integer, number of MC sampling (i.e. sampling N process and average)}

\item{k}{integer (only for k-fold type)}

\item{percent}{from 1 to 100 (only for lpo type)}

\item{times}{how many test cases (only for lpo type)}

\item{test_idx}{a list of indices of the data (which data points to be predicted) (only for custom type)}

\item{train_idx}{a list of indices of the data (which data points to be used for re-sampling (not re-estimation)) (only for custom type)}

\item{keep_test_information}{logical, keep test information (pred_1, pred_2) in the return (as attributes), pred_1 and pred_2 are the prediction of the two chains}
}
\value{
a list of criterions: MSE, MAE, CRPS, sCRPS
}
