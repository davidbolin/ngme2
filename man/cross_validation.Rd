  seed = NULL,
  print = FALSE,
  N = 5,
  n_gibbs_samples = 100,
  n_burnin = 100,

}
\arguments{
\item{ngme}{a ngme object, or a list of ngme object (if comparing multiple models)}

\item{type}{character, in c("k-fold", "loo", "lpo", "custom")
k-fold is k-fold cross-validation, provide \code{k}
loo is leave-one-out,
lpo is leave-percent-out, provide \code{percent} from 1 to 100
custom is user-defined group, provide \code{target} and \code{data}}

\item{seed}{random seed}

\item{print}{print information during computation}

\item{N}{integer, number of simulations (e.g., estimate MAE, MSE, .. N times)}

\item{n_gibbs_samples}{number of gibbs samples}

\item{n_burnin}{number of burnin}

\item{k}{integer (only for k-fold type)}

\item{percent}{how many percent for testing? from 0 to 1 (for lpo type)}

\item{times}{how many test cases (only for lpo type)}

\item{transform}{a function to transform the data (e.g., log, exp, ...)
e.g., the MAE will be computed as |transform(Y) - transform(Y_pred)|}

\item{test_idx}{a list of indices of the data (which data points to be predicted) (only for custom type)}

\item{train_idx}{a list of indices of the data (which data points to be used for re-sampling (not re-estimation)) (only for custom type)}

\item{keep_pred}{logical, keep test information (pred_1, pred_2) in the return (as attributes), pred_1 and pred_2 are the prediction of the two chains}

\item{parallel}{logical, run in parallel mode}
}
\value{
1. mean of N estimations of 4 criterions: MSE, MAE, CRPS, sCRPS
 2. standard deviation of N estimations of 4 criterions: MSE, MAE, CRPS, sCRPS
