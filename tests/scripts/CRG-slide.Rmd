### What is ngme2?

`ngme2` is the updated version of `ngme` (https://github.com/davidbolin/ngme).

`ngme2` is an R package that contains functions for **inference and prediction** for **Gaussian and non-Gaussian** latent models.

The package has support for linear mixed effects models, spatial random field models, and multivariate random fields...

It is an ongoing work with **David Bolin**, **Alexandre B. Simas**, and **Jonas Wallin**.


## Features

1. Support spatial models like Matern model with non-Gaussian noise.
2. Support models for temporal data like **AR1** and **random walk** of order 1 and 2.
3. Support replicates at same locations.
4. Support prediction at unknown locations.
5. Model corss-validation.
6. Comparing to the previous version, it now supports multiple stochastic processes in the latent model.
