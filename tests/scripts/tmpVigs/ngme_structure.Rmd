## Introduction

In this vignette we provide a brief introduction to the structure `ngme2` package.
We believe it can be helpful for understanding the structure and logic of ngme2 package.

## 1. Noise object

In `ngme2`, a noise object can be created and specified using `ngme.noise` function.
The noise object can be used both for the process and for the measurement noise.

```{r noise}
# We can specify the noise by use different function and
# using different parameter.
norm_noise <- noise_normal(sd = 3)
nig_noise <- noise_nig(mu = 1, sigma = 2, nu = 3)
```

Explore more using `str` and `plot` function.

```{r}
# short information
nig_noise

# structure
str(nig_noise)

```

Here the "B_" object is for specifing non-stationary noise.
"fix_" is for fixing the parameter during the estimation.
These parts can also be supplied to the noise object.
See `?ngme.noise`.

```{r}
# We can also plot the noise to see the density
# (only for stationary noise)
plot(nig_noise)
```

## 2. Model object

The model contains two parts, one is the operator (K) structure, the other is noise.
Here we take a simple example - ar1 model with nig noise.
We can also check the structure with `str`.

```{r}
ar1 <- f(index = 1:4, model = "ar1", noise = nig_noise)
str(ar1)
```

## 3. ngme object

The most general object is the `ngme` object.
It contains three parts:

1. a list of model objects,
2. fixed effects
3. measurement noise object.

We can use the `ngme` function (with estimation = FALSE) to construct it.

```{r}
# generate some random data
n <- 20; x1 <- rexp(n); x2 <- rnorm(n); y <- x1 + x2 + 3 + rnorm(n, sd = 0.3)

ngme_model <- ngme(
  formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + f(1:n, model = "ar1"),
  data = list(y = y, x1 = x1, x2 = x2),
  control = ngme.control(
    estimation = FALSE
  )
)

ngme_model

# still, we can check the internal structure using str()
str(ngme_model)
```
