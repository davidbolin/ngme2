The default C++ compiler in OS X has does not support OpenMP.

```
➜ clang -fopenmp hello.cpp
clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'
```

In order to make use of OpenMP to enable multi-threading in OS X, we need to
use compilers which supports OpneMP.

### 1. Install a OpenMP supported clang as default C/C++ compiler.

That's why we need to install another compiler which supports OpenMP.
Here I use `homebrew` for installing llvm clang compiler using the following scripts.
(Check here [homebrew](https://brew.sh) or you can just run the following command to install `homebrew`.)

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If successful, you should be able to see the following prompt.

```
➜ brew install llvm

...
To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/c++ -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/c++"

llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
```

To make the llvm clang default compiler, we need to update the **PATH** variable,
and then reopen the terminal to make it work:

```
➜ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Now we should be able to use the llvm clang with OpenMP support.
Let's test it:


```
➜ clang -fopenmp hello.cpp
```

In my case, the llvm **lib** and **include** folder are already added
into the default clang search path. (You can check the search path by run commands like
`clang hello.cpp -v`, otherwise you may need to include mannually by `-L` and `-I`,
you can also export it as system variable as suggested, then use makefile to compile).

### 2. Configure the R environment to make use of the new compiler.

Next if we want to use OpenMP in our R code (maybe exported it as R function using
Rcpp package), we should make sure R to call our new compiler, not the original one.
To do this, we can mannually set the `Makeconf` file (makefile configuration for R) in
$R_HOME/etc/Makeconf.

Here you can check the R_HOME address using `R.home()` in R termnial.

```{r}
R.home()
```

In my case, the R called compiler is still the default clang, so I explicitly replace it.
Replace the configuration lines with following (where llvm clang is installed):

```
CC = /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
CXX = /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++
CXX11 = $(CXX)
CXX14 = $(CXX)
CXX17 = $(CXX)
CXX20 = $(CXX)
```

Now we should be able to export an OpenMP function in R using Rcpp.

### 3. Configure the R package environment.

If you are developing a R package using Rcpp, then you still need to make more efforts in
the R package environment.

1. Set OpenMP flags in R Makeconf

Do not directly setting `-fopenmp` flag in Makevar file, it would be not portable to the system
with no OpenMP support. It's better to include it in the R Makeconf file. You can find the
following two flags in Makeconf file.

```
SHLIB_OPENMP_CFLAGS = -fopenmp
SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS = -fopenmp
```

2. Set package flags in package Makevar

Next we can include this flag in the Makevar as following:

```
PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS)
```

3. Set symbols in package Namespace

One important thing next is to indicate you `useDynLib(yourPackage)` in the
Namespace. You can either do it by yourself, or do it using `devtools` package for you.

Edit the NAMESPACE file to create R objects for the registered symbols:

```
useDynLib(yourPackage, .registration = TRUE)
```

Or add `#' @useDynLib yourPackage, .registration = TRUE` it into `yourPackage.R` file, then run


```
devtools::document()
```

Then you should be able to see the update in your NAMESPACE file.

Now you can have the OpenMP facility in your C++ code!
